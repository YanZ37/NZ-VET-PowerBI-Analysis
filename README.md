# NZ VET Enrolment & Completion Trends (2016–2024)
**Policy-Focused Data Analysis for Decision Support**

## Project Summary

This project analyses **enrolment and completion trends in New Zealand’s Vocational Education and Training (VET) system between 2016 and 2024**, using publicly available Ministry of Education administrative data.

The objective is to demonstrate how **system-level data** can be analysed and interpreted to support:
- policy design,
- funding decisions, and
- evaluation of large-scale reform.

---

## Decision Context

Between 2019 and 2024, the VET system experienced overlapping shocks:

- **Structural reform:** Reform of Vocational Education (RoVE), creation of Te Pūkenga  
- **System transition:** disestablishment of ITOs and transfer of industry training  
- **External disruption:** COVID-19  
- **Policy intervention:** Targeted Training and Apprenticeship Fund (TTAF), Apprenticeship Boost  

For decision-makers, this raises practical questions:

- Which enrolment changes reflect **policy impact** versus **temporary incentives**?
- Where has increased participation **not translated into completions**?
- Which learner groups or regions require **targeted responses**, not system-wide fixes?

This project is structured to surface those signals.

## Analytical Focus

The analysis examines trends across:

- **Organisation type:** Te Pūkenga, PTEs, Wānanga, Universities, ITOs  
- **Learner characteristics:** ethnicity, age, gender  
- **Programme characteristics:** qualification level, field of study  
- **Geography:** regional participation and outcomes  

The emphasis is on:
- pattern detection,
- identification of structural breaks, and
- policy-relevant interpretation.

Causal attribution is **explicitly avoided**.

## What Was Done

- Reshaped multi-year **administrative summary data**
- Identified **inflection points** aligned with reform, COVID-19, and funding changes
- Compared **relative performance** across providers and learner groups
- Produced **stakeholder-ready visualisations** (dashboard + figures)
- Documented **data limitations and interpretation risks**

The workflow prioritises **clarity, auditability, and decision relevance**.

---

## Key Insights (High-Level)

- **Participation:** highly responsive to short-term funding incentives  
- **Completions:** improved more slowly and unevenly than enrolments  
- **Provider variation:** Wānanga consistently recorded stronger completion outcomes  
- **System risk:** Te Pūkenga’s scale masks structurally lower completion rates  
- **Equity:** younger learners, male learners, and higher-level certificates were most disrupted during COVID-19  

> Interpretation: enrolment growth alone is an insufficient indicator of system performance.

---

## Data & Limitations

- **Source:** Ministry of Education (NZ) published summary statistics  
- **Completion measure:** same-year completion (not cohort-based)  
- **Constraints:** no individual learner tracking or pathway analysis  

Findings indicate **patterns and risks**, not causal effects.

## Outputs

### Analytical Report
A structured narrative suitable for:
- policy teams,
- strategy units,
- evaluation scoping.

### Dashboard
Interactive visuals enabling:
- rapid comparison across providers and groups,
- identification of trend breaks,
- briefing-level discussion with stakeholders.
